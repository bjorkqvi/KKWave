Written by Jan-Victor Björkqvist. However, the original code taking care of the actual propagation and physics is writeen by Kimmo Kahma, and several of the modifications implemented by Heidi Petterson are also used.

This model was used in the publication: Johansson, M. M., Björkqvist, J.-V., Särkkä, J., Leijala, U., and Kahma, K. K.: Correlation of wind waves and sea level variations on the coast of the seasonally ice-covered Gulf of Finland, Nat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss. [preprint], https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2021-55, in review, 2021.
